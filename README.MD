# HTML, Gulp, SCSS, and Babel Template

A barebones HTML, SCSS, Gulp and Babel project.

## Getting Started

Run yarn install to install packages.
Builds to build/ via package scripts:

- `yarn run build` uses gulp to generate a build
- `yarn run build:watch` watches and recompiles src/js and src/scss sources on change

### Prerequisites

A working node environment with the yarn module installed.

## Deployment

The site can be deployed by transferring the build/ directory to a webhost, or via Netlify.
